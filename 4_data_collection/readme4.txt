TypeMania Data Collection

We used mp3 data in our project to generate our song database for song selection and gameplay. Song data collection was conducted by manually by downloading three selected songs from the music provider, SoundCloud. Songs were manually added to the project code assets folder. In future software iterations, mp3 files will be stored and accessed via the cloud-based mongodb database.
